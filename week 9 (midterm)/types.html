                <p>The monarch butterfly is known by scientists as Danaus plexippus, which in Greek literally means "sleepy transformation." The name evokes the species' ability to hibernate and metamorphize.</p>

                <h2>Swallowtail Butterfly</h2>

                </a>
                <p>Certain species of swallowtail practice Batesian mimicry; their appearance can closely resemble other butterfly species that predators find distasteful. Some swallowtail caterpillars eat plants that contain toxic defense chemicals and integrate these compounds into their bodies to prevent being eaten.</p>

                <h2>Morpho Butterfly</h2>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpGTGm01_9o" target="morpho"></a>
                <img src="morpho.jpg" alt="Morpho" width="160">
                <p>Their vivid, iridescent blue coloring is a result of the microscopic scales on the backs of their wings, which reflect light. The underside of the morpho's wings, on the other hand, is a dull brown color with many eyespots, providing camouflage against predators such as birds and insects when its wings are closed.</p>

                    <h2>Red Admiral Butterfly</h2>

                    <img src="red.jpg" alt="red admiral" width="180">
                    <p>Red Admirals are considered to be people-friendly butterflies that will approach and perch on human beings. In regard to other butterflies of their species, however, the male butterflies are known to be territorial in order to find a mate.</p>

                        <p> It is one of the first butterflies to be seen in spring and in the autumn it often visits garden flowers in large numbers..</p>
