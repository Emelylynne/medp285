        <h2>The History of Sky Blue</h2>
        <blockquote>Sky blue refers to a collection of shades comparable to that of a clear daytime sky. Typically it is a shade of cyan or light teal, though some iterations are closer to light blue. The term (as "sky blew") is attested from 1681</blockquote>
    <blockquote>is the colloquial name for the pale turquoise blue colour. The same word, meaning "of the sky", is used in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian for the colour. Etymologically, it is derived by Latin term caelestis, that means del cielo in Italian</blockquote>
    <blockquote>reality, it can be difficult to observe the pure celeste, being the color of a clear day with optimal meteorological factories; other shades of blue are often visible in the sky, as Light Sky Blue and similar gradations, among which the other conventional celeste,[13] similar to the light blue sky colours rather than the pure celeste.<blockquote>
