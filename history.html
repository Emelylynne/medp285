    <h2>The History of Sky Blue</h2>
        <blockquote>Due to blues rarity in nature, it has a shorter history than other colors. Blue is not present in cave paintings from 20,000 years ago, and the Ancient Greeks did not have a term for blue.</blockquote>
    <h2>Culture</h2>
        <blockquote>Though blue was worn mainly by royalty for many centuries, it became a more common color in 431 AD. The Catholic Church depicted the Virgin Mary in a blue robe, adding a positive meaning to the color.</blockquote>
    <h2>Material</h2> 
        <blockquote>The color blue symbolizes confidence and authority that is noninvasive and objective. Unlike red, blue is nonthreatening, fostering peace, dependability and security. Since the color produces a slow physiological response, blue is also the color of creativity. Light blue shades improve concentration, and dark blue hues improve thought processes.</blockquote>  
    <h2>Poetics</h2>  
        <blockquote>The feelings of blue can be paradoxical. Since the sky and bodies of water are blue, the color is associated with calmness and serenity. Being around blue can lower a person’s blood pressure and heart rate.<blockquote> 
    <h2>Botany</h2> 
        <blockquote>Blue is also the color of sadness, hence the expression “feeling blue.” The genre of blues music focuses on the loss of money and love. Blue also suppresses the appetite, since blue in food is often a sign of poison or spoilage.</blockquote>    
    <h2>Textiles</h2> 
        <blockquote>The Ancient Egyptians created the first blue pigment around 2,200 B.C. They heated a mixture of sand, ground limestone and copper-containing minerals like malachite or azurite at a high temperature.</blockquote>
    <h2>Fashion</h2>
        <blockquote>Today, synthetic indigo creates the dye for blue jeans and other clothing. For food, there are two artificial blue colors — Blue 1 and Blue 2. Blue 2 is also made with indigo.</blockquote>
